Suppose you have made a new `Random` object called `random`:

1. How many possible outcomes does `random.nextInt()` have?      
2. How many possible outcomes does `random.nextInt(256)` have?
3. What is the probability that `random.nextFloat()` generates a number above or equal to 0.8?
4. What is the probability that `int value = random.nextFloat() < 0.2 ? random.nextInt(2) : 1 + random.nextInt(4)` is assigned to `1`?
5. What is the probability of `random.nextInt(random.nextInt(3))` producing `0`?

> **Assistant's note:** What happens when `nextInt(0)` is called? ðŸ¤”

You may answer with a fraction (`a/b`), an expression of the form c*x^y, a percentage or a decimal number.
